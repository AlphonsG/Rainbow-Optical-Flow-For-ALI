	abstract = {One of the many components used in biometrics is optical flow estimation. This could be due to the fact that motion is an inseparable attribute of our (visual) world and hence it is a valuable resource of data needed to tackle many real-world problems. Indeed, technologies that use object detection, motion detection, object tracking, gait recognition as well as video compression heavily rely on optical flow estimation. This chapter explores recent advances in optical flow estimation, while mainly focusing on estimation techniques based on deep learning (DL). In fact, recent advancements in deep learning are seemingly making a shift in the optical flow estimation research field. This chapter begins with reviewing traditional (handcrafted) approaches, then introduces the more recent approaches, and finally gets concluded with surveying deep learning approaches.},

	abstract = {Collective cell migration is an important feature of wound healing, as well as embryonic and tumor development. The origin of collective cell migration is mainly intercellular interactions through effects such as a line tension preventing cells from detaching from the boundary. In contrast, in this study, we show for the first time that the formation of a constant cell front of a monolayer can also be maintained by the dynamics of the underlying migrating single cells. Ballistic motion enables the maintenance of the integrity of the sheet, while a slowed down dynamics and glass-like behavior cause jamming of cells at the front when two monolayers—even of the same cell type—meet. By employing a velocity autocorrelation function to investigate the cell dynamics in detail, we found a compressed exponential decay as described by the Kohlrausch–William–Watts function of the form , with 1.5 ⩽ β(t) ⩽ 1.8. This clearly shows that although migrating cells are an active, non-equilibrium system, the cell monolayer behaves in a glass-like way, which requires jamming as a part of intercellular interactions. Since it is the dynamics which determine the integrity of the cell sheet and its front for weakly interacting cells, it becomes evident why changes of the migratory behavior during epithelial to mesenchymal transition can result in the escape of single cells and metastasis.},

	abstract = {The healthy and mature epithelial layer is ordinarily quiescent, non-migratory, solid-like, and jammed. However, in a variety of circumstances the layer transitions to a phase that is dynamic, migratory, fluid-like and unjammed. This has been demonstrated in the developing embryo, the developing avian airway, the epithelial layer reconstituted in vitro from asthmatic donors, wounding, and exposure to mechanical stress. Here we examine the extent to which ionizing radiation might similarly provoke epithelial layer unjamming. We exposed primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells maintained in air-liquid interface (ALI) to sub-therapeutic doses (1 Gy) of ionizing radiation (IR). We first assessed: 1) DNA damage by measuring p-H2AX, 2) the integrity of the epithelial layer by measuring transepithelial resistance (TEER), and 3) the extent of epithelial cell differentiation by detecting markers of differentiated airway epithelial cells. As expected, IR exposure induced DNA damage but, surprisingly, disrupted neither normal differentiation nor the integrity of the epithelial cell layer. We then measured cell shape and cellular migration to determine the extent of the unjamming transition (UJT). IR caused cell shape elongation and increased cellular motility, both of which are hallmarks of the UJT as previously confirmed. To understand the mechanism of IR-induced UJT, we inhibited TGF-β receptor activity, and found that migratory responses were attenuated. Together, these observations show that IR can provoke epithelial layer unjamming in a TGF-β receptor-dependent manner.},

The collective can sometimes flow like a fluid or jam and rigidify like a solid. The unjammed-to-jammed transition remains poorly understood, however, and structural properties characterizing these phases remain unknown. Using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, we show that the jamming transition in asthma is linked to cell shape, thus establishing in that system a structural criterion for cell jamming. Surprisingly, the collapse of critical scaling predicts a counter-intuitive relationship between jamming, cell shape and cell–cell adhesive stresses that is borne out by direct experimental observations. Cell shape thus provides a rigorous structural signature for classification and investigation of bronchial epithelial layer jamming in asthma, and potentially in any process in disease or development in which epithelial dynamics play a prominent role.},

	abstract = {The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the unjamming transition (UJT) each comprises a gateway to cellular migration, plasticity and remodeling, but the extent to which these core programs are distinct, overlapping, or identical has remained undefined. Here, we triggered partial EMT (pEMT) or UJT in differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells. After triggering UJT, cell-cell junctions, apico-basal polarity, and barrier function remain intact, cells elongate and align into cooperative migratory packs, and mesenchymal markers of EMT remain unapparent. After triggering pEMT these and other metrics of UJT versus pEMT diverge. A computational model attributes effects of pEMT mainly to diminished junctional tension but attributes those of UJT mainly to augmented cellular propulsion. Through the actions of UJT and pEMT working independently, sequentially, or interactively, those tissues that are subject to development, injury, or disease become endowed with rich mechanisms for cellular migration, plasticity, self-repair, and regeneration., During repair, development, or cancer metastasis, epithelial cells can become migratory through partial or full epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Here, the authors report that differentiated epithelial collectives may undergo cooperative and collective migration without evidence of partial EMT through an unjamming transition (UJT).},

We obtain this result using both continuum active linear elasticity and a normal modes formalism, and validate analytical predictions with numerical simulations of two agent-based cell models, soft elastic particles and the self-propelled Voronoi model together with in-vitro experiments of confluent corneal epithelial cell sheets. Simulations and normal mode analysis perfectly match when tissue-level reorganisation occurs on times longer than the persistence time of cell motility. Our analytical model quantitatively matches measured velocity correlation functions over more than a decade with a single fitting parameter.},

	abstract = {Background Bronchial epithelial tight junctions (TJ) have been extensively assessed in healthy airway epithelium. However, no studies have yet assessed the effect of human rhinovirus (HRV) infection on the expression and resultant barrier function in epithelial tight junctions (TJ) in childhood asthma. Objectives To investigate the impact of HRV infection on airway epithelial TJ expression and barrier function in airway epithelial cells (AECs) of children with and without asthma. Furthermore, to test the hypothesis that barrier integrity and function is compromised to a greater extent by HRV in AECs from asthmatic children. Methods Primary AECs were obtained from children with and without asthma, differentiated into air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures and infected with rhinovirus. Expression of claudin-1, occludin and zonula occluden-1 (ZO-1) was assessed via qPCR, immunocytochemistry (ICC), in-cell western (ICW) and confocal microscopy. Barrier function was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER; RT) and permeability to fluorescent dextran. Results Basal TJ gene expression of claudin-1 and occludin was significantly upregulated in asthmatic children compared to non-asthmatics; however, no difference was seen with ZO-1. Interestingly, claudin-1, occludin and ZO-1 protein expression was significantly reduced in AEC of asthmatic children compared to non-asthmatic controls suggesting possible post-transcriptional inherent differences. HRV infection resulted in a transient dissociation of TJ and airway barrier integrity in non-asthmatic children. Although similar dissociation of TJ was observed in asthmatic children, a significant and sustained reduction in TJ expression concurrent with both a significant decrease in TER and an increase in permeability in asthmatic children was observed. Conclusion This study demonstrates novel intrinsic differences in TJ gene and protein expression between AEC of children with and without asthma. Furthermore, it correlates directly the relationship between HRV infection and the resultant dissociation of epithelial TJ that causes a continued altered barrier function in children with asthma.},

Here, we show that conditionally reprogrammed airway epithelial cells (CRAECs) can be established from both healthy and diseased phenotypes. CRAECs can be expanded, cryopreserved and maintain phenotypes over at least 5 passages. Population doublings of CRAEC cultures were significantly greater than standard cultures, but maintained their lineage characteristics. CRAECs from all phenotypes were also capable of fully differentiating at air-liquid interface (ALI) and maintained disease specific characteristics including; defective CFTR channel function cultures and the inability to repair wounds. Our findings indicate that CRAECs derived from children maintain lineage, phenotypic and importantly disease-specific functional characteristics over a specified passage range.},

	abstract = {The air-liquid interface (ALI) approach is primarily used to mimic respiratory tract epithelia in vitro. It is also known to support excellent differentiation of 3D multilayered skin models. To establish an ALI culture, epithelial cells are seeded into compartmentalized culture systems on porous filter supports or gel substrata. After an initial propagation period, the culture medium is removed from the apical side of the epithelium, exposing the cells to the surrounding air. Therefore, nutritive supply to the cells is warranted only by the basolateral cell pole. Under these conditions, the epithelial cells differentiate and regain full baso-apical polarity. Some types of epithelia even generate in vivo-like apical fluid or mucus. Interestingly, the ALI culture approach has also been shown to support morphological and functional differentiation of epithelial cells that are not normally exposed to ambient air in vivo. This review aims at giving a brief overview on the characteristics of ALI cultures in general and ALI models of female reproductive tract epithelia in particular. We discuss the applicability of ALI models for the investigation of the early embryonic microenvironment and for its implications in assisted reproductive technologies.},

	abstract = {Occlusions pose a significant challenge to optical flow algorithms that rely on local evidences. We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the first frame but not in the next, a slight overloading of the standard definition since it also includes points that move out-of-frame. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work relies on CNNs to learn occlusions, without much success, or requires multiple frames to reason about occlusions using temporal smoothness. In this paper, we argue that the occlusion problem can be better solved in the two-frame case by modelling image self-similarities. We introduce a global motion aggregation module, a transformer-based approach to find long-range dependencies between pixels in the first image, and perform global aggregation on the corresponding motion features. We demonstrate that the optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. This approach obtains new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset, improving the average end-point error by 13.6\% on Sintel Final and 13.7\% on Sintel Clean.

	abstract = {Motion analysis is one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in the field of computer vision, which can be widely applied in many areas, such as autonomous driving, action recognition, scene understanding, and robotics. In general, the displacement field between subsequent frames can be divided into two types: optical flow and scene flow. The optical flow represents the pixel motion of adjacent frames. In contrast, the scene flow is a 3D motion field of the dynamic scene between two frames. Traditional approaches for the estimation of optical flow and scene flow usually leverage the variational technique, which can be solved as an energy minimization process. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful technique for learning feature representations directly from data. It has led to remarkable progress in the field of optical flow and scene flow estimation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of optical flow and scene flow estimation. First, we briefly review the pioneering approaches that use variational technique and then we delve in detail into the deep learning-based approaches. Furthermore, we present insightful observations on evaluation issues, specifically benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we give the promising directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to review both optical flow and scene flow estimation, and the first to cover both traditional and deep learning-based approaches.},
